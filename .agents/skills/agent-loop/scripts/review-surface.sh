# Shared trusted-surface contract for the agent-loop review launchers.

# Sourced by run-agy-review.sh and run-claude-review.sh; not directly
# executable. It lives in ONE file on purpose: these checks are a supply-chain
# control (the reviewer must read its instructions from the source checkout,
# never from the issue worktree the worker just wrote), and two copies of a
# security contract drift. The caller sets `engine` before sourcing; this file
# validates the environment and the surface, then exports `prompt` and
# `review_timeout_seconds` for the caller to launch with.
